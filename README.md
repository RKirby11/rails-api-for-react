# Rails API (Corresponds with react-learning repository)

This API was built as part of a personal project (see https://github.com/RKirby11/react-learning) to manage the user authentication and database management. 

The API handles users signing up and logging in (providing a JWT token to authenticate on the front end), storing and delivering an image url of their uploaded work (utilising AWS S3 for file storage), and producing a random word each day to inspire the users.

This project was focused on learning Rails and NextJS so is not complete or deployed yet.
